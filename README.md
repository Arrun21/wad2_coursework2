Justification for any changes from your development plans
<br>
<br>
Decided to remove welcome page as the specification does not specify it is needed changed landing page to about us page<br>
Removed menu page as it is easier for the users to choose lunch menu or main menu from nav bar this is more efficient<br>
Changed format for lunch and main menu page to make it more similar to how restaurants have their dishes placed on a menu<br>
Included navigation to login and register page and staff home, add and edit to make interaction more smooth<br>
Removed login with fb, google or apple and forgot password and remember me as I did not see the need for these functions anymore after talking to lecturer<br>
Changed the layout of staffhome to make it more pleasant for staff as before it looked the same as staff add and edit<br>
Changed the function of the star , now by clicking on the star it makes the dish unavailable compared to before<br>
Removed the cancel button as I did not see the need for a cancel button<br>
Changed the layout of mobile views according to the changes I made for desktop view
